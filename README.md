# Delta-Sigma-Converter-Simulation
#
The purpuse of this python program is to show the logic of a delta-sigma adc. When started, it asks you first for the number of integration-cycles, you want. Try different numbers to learn, who delta-sigma approximation works. Next you will be asked, what voltage you want to measure. Please choose a value below 2.0 volts (only for demonstration). Next you will be asked, what your reference voltage is. This entry is not critical. Choose 2 oder 3 volts. 

You get a list which shows step by step how the measured voltage is found. when the list is done, you get a grafical output that shows nicely how the approximation did run.
